          <h2>Why a Home Maintenance Subscription?</h2>
          <p class="intro">If you’ve never heard of a handyman subscription, you’re not alone. But around here, it’s exactly what homeowners have been needing.</p>
        
          <ul class="subscription-benefits">
            <li><strong>Prevent bigger repairs.</strong> Small issues like a loose faucet, leaky pipe, or drafty door become expensive problems if ignored. We catch them early—before they cost you.</li>
            
            <li><strong>No more scrambling.</strong> You don’t have to Google or call around when something breaks. We’re already scheduled, already trusted, and just a message away.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Trust and familiarity.</strong> This isn’t a random tech showing up to your house. It’s the same professional—me—who knows your home and cares for it like it’s my own.</li>
            
            <li><strong>More than handyman work.</strong> This is proactive care—checking your home’s health the same way you’d service your car or furnace. We inspect, repair, adjust, and keep things running smoothly.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Built-in value.</strong> Every visit includes dedicated service time, preferred pricing, free estimates, and ongoing access to a finish carpenter with a full workshop at your service.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        
        <p>
          Choose a plan that fits your home, your pace, and your priorities. Every plan includes scheduled visits, trusted service, and the peace of mind that comes from knowing who to call.
