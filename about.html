    <h2 class="sticky-heading">About Housewell:</h2>
    <p>
        I started Housewell after years of building custom fireplaces, cabinetry, and finish work for homeowners across southern Ohio. I’ve always loved making things, solving problems, and leaving things better than I found them. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Over time, clients started asking for more—installing light fixtures, repairing trim, fixing drywall, even painting and plumbing odds and ends. What I heard again and again was how hard it was to find someone trustworthy, skilled, and responsive. That stuck with me.
      </p>
      <p>
        When two clients independently suggested I become a “handyman on retainer,” I did some digging—and realized they were right. A small, service-focused business like Housewell could offer huge value to the right clients—while letting me do work I enjoy and believe in.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, my wife and I run Housewell from our home. We’re quiet, hardworking people with a simple goal: take care of folks, do honest work, and provide for our family doing something we love.
