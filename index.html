        <h2>Your home, in trusted hands.</h2>
        <p>Your home is your biggest investment. Don’t let costly repairs catch you by surprise. Staying on top of maintenance and small repairs can help prevent big problems later on, but many of us just don’t have the time to keep up with it.</p>
        </p>What if you could have your own personal “handyman on retainer”? A skilled, reliable expert you can trust to keep up with all of those little things for you. That’s what you get with Housewell. A trained carpenter with years of experience making scheduled, regular visits to your home with a personalized checklist focused on efficiency and emergency prevention.

        <h2>What Makes Housewell Different?</h2>
        <p>
          Housewell isn’t a traditional handyman service. We don’t do rushed jobs or one-time fixes unless they’re the right fit. Instead, we offer an ongoing, relationship-based model built for homeowners who want a long-term, reliable partner to help care for their home.
        </p>
        <p>
          You’re not just hiring a handyman—you’re essentially putting a finish carpenter and problem-solver on call, with a full workshop behind him. Whether it’s fixing that sticking door, installing new fixtures, or finally getting that custom shelf built, Housewell is here to help keep your home in shape and stress off your plate.

        <h2>Our Subscription Model</h2>
        <p>
          What if you had someone you could call for regular upkeep and small projects—without having to chase down a contractor or wonder what it’ll cost every time?
        </p>
        <p>
          Housewell offers simple subscription plans designed to give you peace of mind and reliable help when you need it. Each plan includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Scheduled visits (monthly or quarterly)</li>
          <li>Priority scheduling for additional needs</li>
          <li>Ongoing help with home maintenance, repairs, and upgrades</li>
          <li>Access to a fully-equipped woodshop for custom work</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It’s like having a trusted family craftsman on retainer—someone who knows your home and keeps it in good shape year-round.
