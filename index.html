        <p>
            Housewell isn’t a franchise. It’s a family-run business built on trust, hard work, and decades of hands-on skill. From custom carpentry to small home repairs, you get a craftsman you can count on—every time.

        <h2>What Makes Housewell Different?</h2>
        <p>
          Housewell isn’t a traditional handyman service. We don’t do rushed jobs or one-time fixes unless they’re the right fit. Instead, we offer an ongoing, relationship-based model built for homeowners who want a long-term, reliable partner to help care for their home.
        </p>
        <p>
          You’re not just hiring a handyman—you’re essentially putting a finish carpenter and problem-solver on call, with a full workshop behind him. Whether it’s fixing that sticking door, installing new fixtures, or finally getting that custom shelf built, Housewell is here to help keep your home in shape and stress off your plate.

        <h2>Our Subscription Model</h2>
        <p>
          What if you had someone you could call for regular upkeep and small projects—without having to chase down a contractor or wonder what it’ll cost every time?
        </p>
        <p>
          Housewell offers simple subscription plans designed to give you peace of mind and reliable help when you need it. Each plan includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Scheduled visits (monthly or quarterly)</li>
          <li>Priority scheduling for additional needs</li>
          <li>Ongoing help with home maintenance, repairs, and upgrades</li>
          <li>Access to a fully-equipped woodshop for custom work</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It’s like having a trusted family craftsman on retainer—someone who knows your home and keeps it in good shape year-round.
